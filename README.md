Web Audio Multiple Track Waveform Editor
=================

##[Donate to the Project](http://igg.me/at/waveform-playlist)

Inspired by [Audacity](http://audacity.sourceforge.net/), this project is a multiple track playlist editor written completely in javascript using the [Web Audio API](http://webaudio.github.io/web-audio-api/).

For help with setup check the [wiki](https://github.com/naomiaro/waveform-playlist/wiki)

##[Try out the waveform editor!](http://naomiaro.github.io/waveform-playlist/examples/web-audio-editor.html)

Load tracks and set cues (track cue in, cue out), fades (track fade in, fade out) and track start/end times within the playlist.
I've written up some demos on github for the different [audio fade types](https://github.com/naomiaro/Web-Audio-Fades) in the project.

Save your progress by outputing editor state json.
[Localstorage](http://diveintohtml5.info/storage.html) has been used to save/restore editor state.
